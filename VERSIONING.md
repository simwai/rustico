# Versioning

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- If you have fixed a bug: increase the patch version
If you have introduced new functionality in a non-breaking way: increase the minor version (and reset patch to 0)
- If you have introduced breaking changes: increase the major version (and reset the patch and minor version to 0).
- If you are unsure whether your change is a breaking change or not - consider your package (or API) from its consumers' perspectives. If their code has to change as a result of your change then it's a breaking change.
